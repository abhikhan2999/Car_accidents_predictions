# Car Accidents Predictions Using Linear Reressions, RandomForest, LSTM, Fbprophet and Neural Network

## Process
### The Data taken from Kaggle for a specifi city of 3 Years
### The data is cleaned, Preporcessed, Visualzied and Feature Selected 
### The Accidents for each next date is predicted using Different ML Algo and then the accuracy measured
### I have applied the models for the 3 months data to save time and computaional costs and acheived awsome results which you can find in the repository
